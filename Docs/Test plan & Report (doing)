Test plan and reports

□ Database construction in stage of realization and test
Test preparation, realization, integrated test, system test and activities for writing a guideline are performed in the realization and test stage. The test plan is written through test preparation activities, and the design on the component test is carried out. The component and system are realized through realization activities, and the server component is linked by realizing the user interface. If its realization is complete, the integrated test and system test are executed, and its guideline is written. The following figure and table show a general procedure of the realization and test stages.

□ In the procedure suggested in Fig. 1, the Database has structure that the RFID-based Data is collected to the integrated center, and also, a system, which purchases a RFID ticket through a u-Ticket office and use it, is constructed. For this, the work defining the logic of and physical model of data is already executed in the Database design activities, and the logic data model and physical data model being calculated from these activities become factors consisting of Data Architecture. The followings are component lists for database construction.
	Center management system such as entry ticket management, tour site management, travel agency management, and tour statistics
	Intermediary companies management system such as companies information management, ticket sales companies management, ticket products management, ticket issue management, statistics management and settlement management 
	Ticket management system such as company’s info, cooperation, intermediary company’s management, RFID ticket management, ticket issue management, vending, refund, closing and settlement

□ Component Realization & User Interface Realization
○ Principles for realization: Combining reusable software outcomes   
	In order to prevent redundant investment in this project building, the modules that exist in u-Tour project are identified, shared, and reused. 
	The changed realization and test of the software goes through the same process as development software.
